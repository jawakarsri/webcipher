# webcipher
#WebCipher is a cryptographic tool used for securing web communications. It typically involves the use of encryption algorithms to protect data transmitted over the internet. These algorithms ensure that the information exchanged between a web server and a client (such as a web browser) remains confidential and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties. Popular web cipher technologies include SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), which encrypts data during transmission between a web server and a client, ensuring secure communication over the internet.
